# OpenCV-On-Line-Video-Tracker-

This project permit to select a target and track it not only at the first frame of a video, but when you decide to do it.
The software still the same as before, but I included the setMouseCallback function to select a target with the mouse, and keep track it.

The software was build with C++, OpenCV 3.2 and OpenCV_Contrib.

Enjoy it !
